I honestly had never expected to take a writing class centered around the theme of homelessness in the city. The subject always sat in the back of my head for the longest time, but when I saw the course being offered, I decided to give it a try, and I think it very well may be one of the best decisions I've ever made. I learnt more than I could ever have hoped about homelessness, what it actually is, what it's not, what the driving forces are behind it, how people manage to live without a roof over their head, and many other topics that I never expected to ask myself about it. My previous misconceptions about homelessness were replaced with a much greater understanding of the actual circumstances and implications surrounding it, and I feel like being enlightened about such a touchy subject has improved my confidence and willingness to talk about it and advocate for those it affects. And in the process, my research and writing skills have been greatly refined through this unique experience. It felt quite empowering to write pieces as if they were going to be published or read by someone important, and I feel like that was the main drive in the maturation of how I write and what I write about. This has been a great experience that I'm glad to have partaken in, and it makes me feel like a better person overall. Even though the class this quarter was entirely virtual, I still learnt a lot, but do feel like it would have been better had I been in the actual classroom and able to collaborate more effectively with my peers. In any case, this has been a good class for me, and I honestly recommend it to everyone else who wishes to take up an English course.

The first piece I decided to revise was the first piece I wrote at the beginning of the class. When I took a look at it at the end of the quarter, I felt like it was very half-hearted and not thorough enough to be considered something I would be proud of, and it was awfully short in my opinion, so I went ahead and redid it. I kept much of the original information, but this time, instead of being just a little self-reflection about what I felt about homelessness and how it impacts me, I made it into a letter directed at the President of the Seattle City Council, M. Lorena Gonz√°lez. In such letter, I directly argue that the city take action into setting up an intervention for its homeless population, especially after the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and how it has "[added] as many as 150 million extreme poor" according to the World Bank. I suggest that the city set up more programs like the Compass Housing Alliance and derive funding from a graduated income tax and the budget for the Seattle Police Department, as not only are police officers not properly trained to deal with people experiencing homelessness, the best approach for solving such is through rehabilitation, not incarceration. And plus, the ultra rich make many times more than the average person could ever dream of, and that's having a negative effect on those further down the economic ladder. I felt that using my refined writing skills to write a persuasive letter directed to the President of the Seattle City Council would have an impact, and that I wouldn't be the only one writing letters to them. Homelessness in Seattle is a real issue, and I wanted to practice writing persuasive arguments directed at a specific person as a form of activism, because I feel like we're gonna need a lot of that if we wish to solve homelessness.

The next work I wanted to redo was my comparative analysis of *Seattle is Dying* and *Nomadland*. This one hit pretty close to home for me, as when I first saw *Seattle is Dying*, it was honestly hard to watch all the way through, as they got so many things wrong about homelessness, to the point where it was straight up misinformation and right wing propaganda cleverly disguised as a documentary. But when I watched *Nomadland*, it was honestly such a breath of fresh air and relieved all the anger I had felt towards *Seattle is Dying*. *Nomadland* accurately portrays what homelessness is like for many people in the United States: they're not homeless, "just houseless," as said in the film, and live in their vans travelling from place to place in search of work. But *Seattle is Dying* focused on only the extreme(ly visible) minority that make up those you see on the streets. It only focused on those who were clearly under the influence of something, and also showed a clear bias in those they interviewed. Reading over what I wrote, I felt like writing merely a comparative analysis between two films was not enough, and that this time, I also had to write a letter. This time, I directed it towards the director of *Seattle is Dying* and talked about how the film inaccurately portrays homelessness and uses dehumanising rhetoric to describe individuals experiencing homelessness. And not only that, but intentionally focusing on a minority of the homeless population and those under the influence paints a really bleak picture of what it's like to be homeless. I requested that the film be taken down and a formal apology be written, and kept in a small comparison of *Seattle is Dying* to *Nomadland* as something to take pointers from should the director ever wish to remake the film. Which is unlikely, but just food for thought. Again here I wanted to do something argumentative and direct in nature as this one really hit me in a soft spot, and I just felt that a comparative analysis wasn't enough.

And finally, the last piece of writing that I wanted to improve upon was the photo essay I did documenting "hostile architecture" in Seattle. I also felt this one was not very thorough or thoughtful the first time I wrote it, but did see that I had a lot of good information and knowledge I could build upon. So what I did was I rewrote and rearranged the paragraphs accompanying the pictures, and turned it into a blog post format, using Markdown and GitHub because that's what I'm most familiar with. The message I wanted to convey was that Seattle's implementations of hostile architecture are doing more harm than good and it needs to stop, as not only is it infringing upon the abilities of those experiencing homelessness to find places to rest and settle, it's also making public spaces feel a lot more unwelcoming and unenjoyable, when they're supposed to be the opposite of that. I've begun to see more of this occurring with basketball courts in Seattle employing two layers of fencing and signs being posted that park hours are from dawn to dusk, causing people to have to reroute or relocate their activities and overall making it feel like the city is out to get us for having fun. I added a couple more images that I captured along with accompanying paragraphs, and at the end argued for a call to action for people to get in touch with the City Council and let them know that this is not okay, as not only is trying to herd around those without a house a fruitless endeavour, but it's also actively diminishing the sense of place and belonging for the rest of those that reside in and visit Seattle, and that the resources used to try to deter people would be better spent on resources to help them. I found a saying somewhere along the lines of, "If you kick a person experiencing homelessness off a bench, you gotta give them somewhere else to sleep for the night, and the answer is not a bed of spikes", and I can honestly agree. This again was practice in a form of activism: rallying a group of people to contribute to a change, because I felt like one sole voice wouldn't be enough for something like this.

This course has me feeling quite accomplished and satisfied, as I was able to train my critical thinking and writing abilities, which will definitely be useful if I have to draft papers as part of an internship or job I might be a part of in my career. On top of that, being educated about what homelessness actually is has helped me see it in a more positive light, and I'm considering volunteering for a local soup kitchen or housing alliance since they're gonna need all the help they can get. One thing that this really boosted my confidence in is writing a potential thesis as part of the doctorate degree I wish to go for, and as of now I feel more ready than ever to tackle such a task. But another thing I wish to work on is fictional writing, as that's something I want to dabble in my free time soon. Either way, my biggest thanks goes out to Alexandra Meany for having the willingness to teach such a course during a time where everything is virtual, and this has been an experience I'll definitely cherish.
